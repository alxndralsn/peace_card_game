# peace_card_game
# In this assignment, you will implement the card game "Peace" (formerly known as War). The goal is to simulate the game where two players draw cards and compare them. The player with the higher card wins the round. If the cards are equal, a "war" occurs.

# You will need to:
# Implement functions to manage the game logic.
# Use lists and tuples for card representation.
# Ensure that the game continues until one player wins all the cards.

# Tips:
# Think about how you will represent each card and playerâ€™s hand.
# Consider using loops to manage the game flow and round structure.
# Ensure to handle the war scenario appropriately to avoid infinite loops.
# Note, you may need to Google some things to solve this! That's OK
# Note, the program might run really fast. Feel free to import time at the top of the file, and use time.sleep(1) to delay the program execution by 1 second (or any amount you want) to make it playable. You can also use input("Press enter to continue...) to slow the execution of the game
